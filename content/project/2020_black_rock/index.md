As part of the BlackRock's [Factor Based Strategies Group](https://www.blackrock.com/uk/professionals/solutions/factor-based-investing#investment-strategies) I explored how some ESG criteria such as carbon emissions can impact return on investment. I've built different Bayesian network models to help understand this relationship.
