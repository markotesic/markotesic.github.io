abstract: "Recent years have witnessed an explosion in the general-purpose capabilities of AI systems. These advancements pose unique challenges to how AI systems should be evaluated. Estimating capabilities, rather than performance, is necessary for systems that are not built for specific tasks, but for general-purpose use, and to anticipate the fit of an AI system for situations and occupations requiring particular cognitive skill levels to cope with the expected demands. The techniques and methodologies from the cognitive sciences are more appropriate than task-oriented benchmarks for this evaluation of capability, but require a common language and toolkit to facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration. One promising approach in this regard is the Measurement Layouts framework, which leverages large, hierarchical Bayesian Networks to infer the capabilities of AI systems. We propose a half-day lab to introduce AAAI-24 participants to the Measurement Layouts framework, demonstrate the powerful evaluation inferences we can make for different kinds of AI systems (RL agents, language models, etc.) and support building a diverse community of interdisciplinary researchers interested in improving AI evaluation."
