I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher](http://lcfi.ac.uk/people/marko-tesic/) at [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, University of Cambridge](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/kinds-of-intelligence/kinds-intelligence/). I currently explore the capabilities of AI systems and how these capabilities translate onto the specific demands in the human workforce. This research is carried out in collaboration with the OECD and experts in occupational psychology.

Previously, I was a [Royal Academy of Engineering UK IC](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/uk-grants-and-prizes/support-for-research/uk-ic-postdoctoral-research-fellowships/awardees) postdoctoral research fellow investigating the impact of explanations of AI predictions on our beliefs. I also studied people's causal and probabilistic reasoning and have a strong interest in data analysis, causal modeling and Bayesian network analysis. 

I received a Ph.D. in Psychology from [Birkbeck's Psychological Sciences department](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/departments/psychology), an M.A. in Logic and Philosophy of Science from [the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, LMU](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and a B.A. in Philosophy from [University of Belgrade, Serbia](https://www.f.bg.ac.rs/en2). See my [CV](uploads/resume.pdf) for more info on my background, research and work experience.

I also play the violin in [Paprika: The Balkan and East European band](https://www.paprikamusic.com) and [The Pico Players](https://www.thepicoplayers.org).
