abstract: "The development and evaluation of social capabilities in
AI agents require complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent populations outperform
others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention following, are
harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The Melting Pot
contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian
approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that
these capability profiles not only predict future performance within
the Melting Pot suite but also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with better performance, this is not a
universal trend—some lower-scoring agents exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that top-performing contest sub-
missions are more likely to achieve high scores in scenarios where
prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings, together with
reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution tailored to
specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing team
may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary, potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework.
We provide recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose future research directions to account
for biases introduced by different testing environments. Our results
demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer both strong predictive
accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more transparent
and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex social settings."

summary: "We use a Bayesian approach called 'Measurement layouts' to infer prosocial capability profiles of multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot testbed, showing that high performance does not always reflect strong cooperation abilities."
