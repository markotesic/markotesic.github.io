abstract: "Providing an explanation is a communicative act. It includes an explainee, a person who is receiving an explanation, and an explainer, a person (or sometimes a machine) who provides an explanation. The majority of research on explanation has focused on how explanations alter explainees' beliefs. However, one general feature of communicative acts is that they also provide information about the speaker (explainer). Work on argumentation suggests that the speaker reliability interacts with the content of the speaker's message and has a significant impact on argument strength. In four experiments we explore the interplay between explanation, explainee's beliefs, and explainer's reliability. Experiment 1 replicates the results from the previous literature on the impact of explanations on an explainee's beliefs. Experiments 2a and 2b show that providing an explanation not only impacts explainee's beliefs about what is being explained, but also their beliefs about the reliability of the explainer. Additionally, the two experiments also show that the impact of explanation on explainee's beliefs is mediated by the reliability of the explainer. In Experiment 3, we show that providing an explanation has a significantly greater impact on explainee's beliefs when explainer's reliability is low compared to when that reliability is high, and that unreliable explainers who provide (good) explanations may have similar impact on explainee's beliefs as highly reliable explainers who provide no explanation for their claims. Throughout the study we point to the important impact of background knowledge, warranting further studies on this."
