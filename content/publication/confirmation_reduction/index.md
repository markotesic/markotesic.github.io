abstract: In their 2010 paper, Dizadji-Bahmani, Frigg, and Hartmann (henceforth
  'DFH') argue that the generalized version of the Nagel-Schaffner model that
  they have developed (henceforth 'the GNS') is the right one for intertheoretic
  reduction, i.e. the kind of reduction that involves theories with largely
  overlapping domains of application. Drawing on the GNS, DFH (2011) presented a
  Bayesian analysis of the confirmatory relation between the reducing theory and
  the reduced theory and argued that, post-reduction, evidence confirming the
  reducing theory also confirms the reduced theory and evidence confirming the
  reduced theory also confirms the reducing theory, which meets the expectations
  one has about theories with largely overlapping domains. In this paper, I
  argue that the Bayesian analysis presented by DFH (2011) faces difficulties.
  In particular, I argue that the conditional probabilities that DFH introduce
  to model the bridge law entail consequences that run against the GNS. However,
  I also argue that, given slight modifications of the analysis that are in
  agreement with the GNS, one is able to account for these difficulties and,
  moreover, one is able to more rigorously analyse the confirmatory relation
  between the reducing and the reduced theory.
