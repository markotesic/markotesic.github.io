abstract: We provide a novel Bayesian justification of inference to the best
  explanation (IBE). More specifically, we present conditions under which
  explanatory considerations can provide a significant confirmatory boost for
  hypotheses that provide the best explanation of the relevant evidence.
  Furthermore, we show that the proposed Bayesian model of IBE is able to deal
  naturally with the best known criticisms of IBE such as van Fraassen’s ‘bad
  lot’ argument.
